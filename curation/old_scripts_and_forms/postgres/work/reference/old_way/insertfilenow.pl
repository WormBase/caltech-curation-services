We studied sequence conservation patterns and observed that the RabF motifs and the RabSF regions previously described in mammalian Rabs are conserved across species. This is consistent with conserved recognition mechanisms by general regulators and specific effectors. We used phylogenetic analysis and other approaches to reconstruct the multiplication of the Rab family and observed that this family shows a strict phylogeny of function as opposed to a phylogeny of species. Furthermore, we observed that Rabs co-segregating in phylogenetic trees show a pattern of similar cellular localisation and/or function. Therefore, animal and fungi Rab proteins can be grouped in \"Rab functional groups\" according to their segregating patterns in phylogenetic trees. These functional groups reflect similarity of sequence, localisation. and/or function, and may also represent shared ancestry.

Using an automated tracking system to record locomotory behavior over long time periods, we determined that both the direction and velocity of movement fluctuate in a stochastic pattern in wild-type worms. During periods of active egg-laying, the patterns of reversals and velocity were altered: velocity increased transiently before egg-laying events, while reversals increased in frequency following egg-laying events. The temporal coordination between egg-laying and locomotion was dependent on the serotonergic HSN egg-laying motorneurons as well as the decision-making AVF interneurons, which receive synaptic input from the HSNs. Serotonin-deficient mutants also failed to coordinate egg-laying and locomotion and exhibited an abnormally low overall reversal frequency.

Proper tight junction formation and cell polarity require the function of membrane-associated guanylate kinases (MAGUKs) that contain the PDZ protein-protein interaction domain. In contrast, less is known about how adherens junctions are assembled. Here we describe how the PDZ-containing protein DLG-1 is required for the proper formation and function of adherens junctions in Caenorhabditis elegans. DLG-1 is a MAGUK protein that is most similar in sequence to mammalian SAP97, which is found at both synapses of the CNS, as well as at cell junctions of epithelia. DLG-1 is localized to adherens junctions, and DLG-1 localization is mediated by an amino-terminal domain shared with SAP97 but not found in other MAGUK family members. DLG-1 recruits other proteins and signaling molecules to adherens junctions, while embryos that lack DLG-1 fail to recruit the proteins AJM-1 and CPI-1 to adherens junctions. DLG-1 is required for the proper organization of the actin cytoskeleton. and for the morphological elongation of embryos.

However, it remains unclear as to whether this hypersensitivity is caused by direct toxicity of the exogenous oxygen or by the damage of endogenous reactive oxygen species derived from mitochondria. Here we report important biochemical changes in mev-1 animals that serve to explain their abnormalities under normoxic conditions: (i) an overproduction of superoxide anion from mitochondria; and (ii) a reciprocal reduction in glutathione content even under atmospheric oxygen. In addition, unlike wild type, the levels of superoxide anion production from mev-1 mitochondria were significantly elevated under hyperoxia. Under normal circumstances, it is well known that superoxide anion is produced at complexes I and III in the electron transport system. Our data suggest that the mev-1(kn1) mutation increases superoxide anion production at complex II itself rather than at complexes I and III. The mev-1 mutant also had a lactate level 2-fold higher than wild type, indicative of lactic acidosis, a hallmark of human mitochondrial diseases.

By site-directed mutagenesis, we have replaced the conserved amino acid residues found in human VAChT with the mutated residue in CeVAChT and stably expressed these cDNAs in PC-12 cells. These mutants display selective defects in initial acetylcholine ;transport velocity (K-m), with values ranging from 2- to 8-fold lower than that of the wild-type. One of these mutants has lost its specific interaction with vesamicol, a selective inhibitor of VAChT, and displays vesamicol-insensitive uptake of acetylcholine.

Dissociated embryonic cells express a robust outwardly rectifying anion current that is activated by membrane stretch and depolarization. This current, termed I-Cl,I-mec, is inhibited by anion and mechanosensitive channel inhibitors. I-Cl,I-mec has broad anion selectivity and the channel has a unitary conductance of 5-7 picosiemens.

Macroscopic currents of 40-120 pA at +100 mV are typically observed in inside-out membrane patches formed using low resistance patch pipettes. Isolated membrane patches of early embryonic cells therefore contain 60-200 I-Cl,I-mec channels.

This phenomenon was explained by an increase of DOM concentrations in organically enriched treatments and a resulting solubilization of Cd due to Cd complexation by DOM.

In the present paper, we analyze the expression of the ges-1 homolog (Cb-ges-1) from the related nematode Caenorhabditis briggsae and show that Cb-ges-1 also has the ability to switch expression between gut and pharynx + rectum. The control of this expression switch centres on a tandem pair of WGATAR sites in the Cb-ges-1 5\'-flanking region, just as it does in Ce-ges-1. We use sequence alignments and subsequent deletions to identify a region at the 3\'-end of both Ce-ges-1 and Ce-ges-1 that acts as the ges-1 cryptic pharynx enhancer whose activity is revealed by removal of the 5\' WGATAR sites. This region contains a conserved binding site for PHA-4 (the C. elegans ortholog of forkhead/HNF3 alpha, (beta,gamma factors), which is expressed in all cells of the developing pharynx and a subset of cells of the developing rectum. We propose a model in which the normal expression of ges-1 is controlled by the gut-specific GATA factor ELT-2. We propose that, in the pharynx (and rectum), PHA-4 is normally bound to the ges-1 3\'-enhancer sequence but that the activation function of PHA-4 is kept repressed by a (presently unknown) factor binding in the vicinity of the 5\' WGATAR sites.

During asymmetric cell divisions in the early embryo, centrosome pairs initially are positioned on transverse axes but then rotate to align with the anteroposterior embryonic axis. We show that rotation of the centrosomal/nuclear complex in an embryonic cell called P-1 requires a maternally expressed gene we name spn-4. The predicted SPN-4 protein contains a single RNA recognition motif (RRM), and belongs to a small subfamily of RRM proteins that includes one Drosophila and two human family members. Remarkably, in mutant embryos lacking spn-4 function the transversely oriented \'P-1\' mitotic spindle appears to re-specify the axis of cell polarity, and the division remains asymmetric. spn-4 also is required for other developmental processes, including the specification of mesendoderm, the restriction of mesectoderm fate to P-1 descendants, and germline quiescence during embryogenesis.

Recent results indicated that during Drosophila development, cyclin D-dependent kinases regulate cell growth rather than cell division. However, our data indicate that C. elegans cyd-1 primarily controls G1 progression. To investigate whether cyd-1 and cdk-4 solely act to overcome GI inhibition by retinoblastoma family members, we constructed double mutants that completely eliminate the function of the retinoblastoma family and cyclin D-Cdk4/6 kinases. Inactivation of lin-35 Rb, the single Rb-related gene in C elegans, substantially reduced the DNA replication and cell-division defects in cyd-1 and cdk-4 mutant animals. These results demonstrate that lin-35 Rb is an important negative regulator of G1/S progression and probably a downstream target for cyd-1 and cdk-4. However, as the suppression by lin-35 Rb is not complete, cyd-1 and cdk-4 probably have additional targets. An additional level of control over G1 progression is provided by Cip/Kip kinase inhibitors. We demonstrate that lin-35 Rb and cki-1 Cip/Kip contribute nonoverlapping levels of G1/S inhibition in C. elegans. Surprisingly, loss of cki-1, but not lin-35, results in precocious entry into S phase.

Mitotic sister chromatid disjunction requires that cohesion be lost along the entire length of chromosomes, whereas homolog segregation at meiosis I only requires loss of cohesion along chromosome arms. During animal cell mitosis, cohesin is lost in two steps. A nonproteolytic mechanism removes cohesin along chromosome arms during prophase, while the proteolytic cleavage of cohesin\'s Scc1 subunit by separase removes centromeric cohesin at anaphase. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Caenorhabditis elegans, meiotic sister chromatid cohesion is mediated by Rec8, a meiosis-specific variant of cohesin\'s Scc1 subunit. Homolog segregation in S. cerevisiae is triggered by separase-mediated cleavage of Rec8 along chromosome arms. In principle, chiasmata could be resolved proteolytically by separase or nonproteolytically using a mechanism similar to the mitotic \"prophase pathway.\" Results: Inactivation of separase in C. elegans has little or no effect on homolog alignment on the meiosis I spindle but prevents their timely disjunction. It also interferes with chromatid separation during subsequent embryonic mitotic divisions but does not directly affect cytokinesis. Surprisingly, separase inactivation also causes osmosensitive embryos, possibly due to a defect in the extraembryonic structures, referred to as the \"eggshell.\" Conclusions: Separase is essential for homologous chromosome disjunction during meiosis I. Proteolytic cleavage, presumably of Rec8, might be a common trigger for the first meiotic division in eukaryotic cells.

Caenorhabditis elegans counterparts of Rb, E2F/DP, and some NuRD complex components appear to function in a common class B synthetic Multivulva (synMuv) pathway to antagonize RTK/Ras signaling during vulval fate specification [8-11]. Therefore, it has been suggested that they function together in a single complex to repress vulva-specific gene transcription [8, 9, 11]. However, little is known about the in vivo interactions between these class B synMuv genes and their relationships with other pathways in specific cellular processes during vulval development. We show that C. elegans Rb/E2F and NuRD complexes antagonize Ras activity by controlling a lin-39 Hox-mediated cell fusion event that regulates the competence of vulval cells. Interestingly, Rb/E2F and NuRD complexes exhibit very different genetic properties.

Similar to FEM-2, hFEM-2 exhibited PP2C phosphatase activity and associated with FEM-3. hFEM-2 shows striking similarity (79% amino acid identity) to rat Ca2+/calmodulin (CaM)-dependent protein kinase phosphatase (rCaMKPase). hFEM-2 and FEM-2, but not PP2C alpha, were demonstrated to dephosphorylate CaM kinase H efficiently in vitro, suggesting that hFEM-2 and FEM-2 are specific phosphatases for CaM kinase. Furthermore, hFEM-2 and FEM-2 associated with F1A alpha and FEM-1 respectively. Overexpression of hFEM-2, FEM-2, or rCaMKPase all mediated apoptosis in mammalian cells. The catalytically active, but not the inactive, forms of hFEM-2 induced caspase-dependent apoptosis, which was blocked by Bcl-XL or a dominant negative mutant of caspase-9.

In addition, MIF accumulates in nematode somatic cells where its role has not yet been defined. In order to identify the role that MIF plays in the cell biology of nematodes, we have characterized the members of the mif gene family in the free-living species Caenorhabditis elegans. Unlike the single mif gene found in humans and mice, C. elegans expresses four distinct mif genes: Ce-mif-1, Ce-mif-2, Ce-mif-3 and Ce-mif-4. The Ce-MIF proteins are between 15-30% identical to each other, 34-38% identical to the MIFs from the parasitic nematode Brugia malayi, and 22-35% identical to mammalian MIFs. The transcription of Ce-mif-2 and Ce-mif-3, but not Ce-mif-1, was upregulated >100-fold compared to L2 levels when the worms entered the dauer stage. The transcription levels of Ce-mif-2 and Ce-mif-3 fell to near baseline a few hours after exit from dauer. Ce-MIF/GFP transgenic animals and immunostaining were used to demonstrate that the main sites of MIF production are in the hypodermis, body wall muscles and in the nuclei of developing embryos.

In particular, mutations in these genes affect the reestablishment of PAR protein asymmetry in the Pi cell of two-cell embryos. We now report that ooc-5 encodes a putative ATPase of the Clp/Hsp100 and AAA superfamilies of proteins, with highest sequence similarity to Torsin proteins; the gene for human Torsin A is mutated in individuals with early-onset torsion dystonia, a neuromuscular disease. Although Clp/Hsp100 and AAA family proteins have roles in diverse cellular activities, many are involved in the assembly or disassembly of proteins or protein complexes; thus, OOC-5 may function as a chaperone. OOC-5 protein co-localizes with a marker of the endoplasmic reticulum in all blastomeres of the early C. elegans embryo, in a pattern indistinguishable from that of OOC-3 protein. Furthermore, OOC-5 localization depends on the normal function of the ooc-3 gene.

To identify the molecule with transglutaminase activity in C. elegans, we isolated from C. elegans a gene homologous to ERp57, which encodes a protein disulfide isomerase, expressed it in recombinant form, and characterized the transglutaminase and protein disulfide isomerase activities of the resultant protein. The C. elegans ERp57 protein had both enzyme activities, and the transglutaminase activity had similar characteristics to the activity in lysate of the whole worm. These results suggested that the ERp57 homologue was')");

Through this analysis, we show that all eukaryote chromosomes exhibit similar characteristics for their intrachromosomal repeats, suggesting similar dynamics: many direct repeats have their two copies physically close together, and these close direct repeats are more similar and shorter than the other repeats. On the contrary, there are almost no close inverted repeats. These results support a model for the dynamics of duplication. This model is based on a continuous genesis of tandem repeats and implies that most of the distant and inverted repeats originate from these tandem repeats by further chromosomal rearrangements (insertions, inversions, and deletions). Remnants of these predicted rearrangements have been brought out through fine analysis of the chromosome sequence. Despite these dynamics, shared by all eukaryotes, each genome exhibits its own style of intrachromosomal duplication: the density of repeated elements is similar in all chromosomes issued from the same genome, but is different between species. This density was further related to the relative rates of duplication, deletion, and mutation proper to each species.

One of the MES proteins, MES-3, is a novel protein with no recognizable motifs. In this article we show that MES-3 is localized in the nuclei of embryos and germ cells, consistent with its predicted role in transcriptional regulation. Its distribution in the germline and in early embryos does not depend on the wild-type functions of the other MES proteins. However, its nuclear localization in midstage embryos and its persistence in the primordial germ cells depend on wildtype MES-2 and MES-6. These results are consistent with biochemical data showing that MES-2, MES-3, and MES-6 associate in a complex in embryos. The distribution of MES-3 in the adult germline is regulated by the translational repressor GLD-l: MES-3 is absent from the region of the germline where GLD-1 is known to be present, MES-3 is overexpressed in the germline of gld-l mutants, and GLD-1 specifically binds the mes-3 3\' untranslated region (3\' UTR).

Enhancement in this assay was induction of sterility a generation earlier, in the otherwise fertile homozygous progeny of heterozygous mothers, which previous results had suggested represent a sensitized genetic background. We tested seven genes predicted to encode regulators of chromatin organization for RNAi-induced enhancement of mes-3 sterility and identified one enhancer, called set-2 after the SET domain encoded by the gene.

The SRm160 splicing coactivator, an SR-related nuclear matrix protein of 160 kDa, is important for the splicing of specific constitutive and ESE-dependent pre-mRNAs. Results: In the present study, we show that SRm 160 is required to promote pre-mRNA splicing mediated by a large population of functional ESE sequences within a randomized 18 nucleoticle sequence. This suggests that it functions as a general coactivator by interacting with different SIR family/SR-related proteins bound to different ESE sequences. Consistent with this, several SR family and SR-related proteins coimmunoprecipitated specifically with SRm160 in the presence of low salt. We used RNA interference (RNAi) in Caenorhabditis elegans to determine whether interactions between CeSRm 160 and different CeSR family proteins are important in a whole-organism context. Previously we showed that RNAi of CeSRm 160 and individual CeSR family genes other than CeSF2/ASF results in no obvious phenotype, which is indicative of gene redundancy, In the present study, we demonstrate that RNAi of CeSRm 160 in combination with any CeSR family gene results in the production of unfertilized oocytes by the injected mother. Conclusions: The observation that simultaneous suppression of CeSRm 160 and individual CeSR family proteins results in a distinct phenotype is indicative of critical functional interactions between these factors.

However, clk-2(qm37) is the only C. elegans clock mutant that is defective for the DNA damage checkpoint.

In addition, rad-5/clk-2 also regulates the S phase replication checkpoint in C. elegans.

However, the partial loss-of-function C. elegans rad-5(mn 159) and clk-2(qm37) checkpoint mutations have little effect on telomere length, and analysis of the partial loss-of-function of S. cerevisiae tel2-1 mutant failed to reveal typical DNA damage checkpoint defects.

We show that human FKHRL1 can partially replace DAF-16, proving the orthology. In mammalian cells, insulin and insulin-like growth factor signaling activate AKT/PKB kinase to negatively regulate the nuclear localization of DAF-16 homologs (reviewed in [1]). We show that the absence of AKT consensus sites on DAF-16 is sufficient to cause dauer arrest in daf-2(+) animals, proving that daf-16 is the major output of insulin signaling in C. elegans. FKHR, FKRHL1, and AFX may similarly be the major outputs of mammalian insulin signaling. daf-2 insulin signaling, via AKT kinases, negatively regulates DAF-16 by controlling its nuclear localization. Surprisingly, we find that daf-7 TGF-beta signaling also regulates DAF-16 nuclear localization specifically at the time when the animal makes the commitment between diapause and reproductive development. daf-16 function is supported by the combined action of two distinct promoter/enhancer elements, whereas the coding sequences of two major DAF-16 isoforms are interchangeable.

Consistent with predictions of evolutionary trade-off models, we show that nematodes carrying an integrated DAF-16::GFP transgene grow and reproduce more slowly yet are more stress resistant and longer lived than controls carrying the integration marker alone. We also show that the nuclear localization of the DAF-16::GFP fusion protein responds to environmental inputs as well as genetic. Environmental stresses, such as starvation, heat, and oxidative stress, cause rapid nuclear localization of DAF-16. In conditions rich in food, we find that DAF-16::GFP is inhibited from entry into the nucleus by daf-2 and akt-1/akt-2, both components of insulin-like signaling in nematodes.

In Drosophila, there are two classic cadherins: one involved primarily in regulating the morphogenesis of epithelia [5, 6], and the other, DN-cadherin [3], required almost exclusively in neuronal development. In contrast, C. elegans has a single classic cadherin gene, hmr-1, whose function is required for epithelial morphogenesis [7]. We show here that hmr-1 also encodes a second classic cadherin via a novel mechanism involving an alternative, neuron-specific promoter, coupled with alternative splicing. This novel HMR-1 isoform is very similar to DN-cadherin, and a mutant strain that specifically lacks the function of this isoform displays defects in the fasciculation and outgrowth of a subset of motor neuron processes; a phenotype that resembles loss of DN-cadherin function in Drosophila.

Serial observations indicate that fgd-1 mutations lead to developmental excretory cell abnormalities that cause cystic dilation and interfere with canal process extension.

Runx2 plays an essential role in osteogenesis, and inactivation of one allele of Runx2 is responsible for the human disease cleidocranial dysplasia. To understand the role of run in C. elegans, we used transgenic ran::GFP reporter constructs and a double-stranded RNA-mediated interference method. The expression of run was detected as early as the bean stage exclusively in the nuclei of seam hypodermal cells and lasted until the L3 stage. At the larval stage, expression of run was additionally detected in intestinal cells. The regulatory elements responsible for the postembryonic hypodermal seam cells and intestinal cells were separately located within a 7.2-kb-long intron region. This is the first report demonstrating that an intron region is essential for stage-specific and cell type-specific expression of a C elegans gene. RNA interference analysis targeting the run gene resulted in an early larva-lethal phenotype, with apparent malformation of the hypodermis and intestine.

In air-1(RNAi) embryos, centrosomes separate normally, an event that occurs before maturation in C. elegans. After nuclear envelope breakdown, the separated centrosomes collapse together, and spindle assembly fails. In mitotic air-1(RNAi) embryos, centrosomal alpha -tubulin fluorescence intensity accumulates to only 40% of wild-type levels, suggesting a defect in the maturation process. Consistent with this hypothesis, we find that AIR-1 is required for the increase in centrosomal gamma -tubulin and two other PCM components, ZYG-9 and CeGrip, as embryos enter mitosis.

In this study, we show that CBP-1, HDA-1 and POP-1 converge on end-1, an initial endoderm-determining gene. In the E lineage, an essential function of CBP-1 appears to be the activation of end-1 transcription.

Our analyses of fog-1 mutations indicate that each of the three RNA-binding domains of FOG-1 is essential for activity. In addition, biochemical tests show that FOG-1 is capable of binding RNA sequences in the 3\'-untranslated region of its mm message. Finally, genetic assays reveal that fog-1 functions zygotically, that the small fog-1 transcript has no detectable function, and that missense mutations in fog-1 cause a dominant negative phenotype. This last observation suggests that FOG-1 acts in a complex, or as a multimer, to regulate translation.

A comparable response to heat alone requires a substantially higher temperature of 28degreesC, suggesting that microwave heating of worms or of the system as a whole might provide a sufficient explanation, although this can be ruled out by indirect arguments [1]. Here we investigate two further biological consequences of prolonged microwave exposure at 25degreesC in synchronised cultures of wild-type worm larvae, namely alterations in (i) growth rate (GR) and (ii) the proportion of worms later maturing into egg-bearing adults (MP). Both of these parameters are significantly increased following microwave exposure (GR by 8-11%, and MP by 28-40%), whereas both are significantly decreased (GR by 10% and MP almost abolished) after mild heat treatment at 28degreesC for the same period. It follows that the biological consequences of microwave exposure are opposite to, and therefore incompatible with, those attributable to mild heating. This evidence does not in itself necessitate a non-thermal mechanism, but does eliminate explanations that invoke the bulk heating of tissues by microwaves.

Here, we describe the first identification of genes whose expression is controlled by the DAF-2 signaling cascade. dao-1, dao-2, dao-3, dao-4, dao-8 and dao-9 are down-regulated daf-2 mutant adults compared to wild-type adults, zwhereas dao-5, dao-6 and dao-7 are up-regulated.

Positive regulation by DAF-2 on dao-1, dao-4 and dao-8 was mediated by DAF-16, whereas daf-16 mediates only part of DAF-2 signaling for dao-2 and dao-9. Regulation by DAF-2 is most likely DAF-16 independent for dao-3 and hsp-90. RNA levels of dao-5 and dao-6 showed elevated expression in daf-2 adults, as well as being strongly expressed in dauer larvae. In contrast, hsp-90 transcript levels are low in daf-2 mutant adults though they are enriched in dauer larvae, indicating overlapping but not identical mechanisms of efficient life maintenance in stress-resistant dauer larvae and long-lived daf-2 mutant adults. dao-1, dao-8 and dao-9 are homologs of the FK506 binding proteins that interact with the mammalian insulin pathway. dao-3 encodes a putative methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase. DAO-5 shows 33% identity with human nucleolar phosphoprotein P130. dao-7 is similar to the mammalian ZFP36 protein.

However, the non-conserved regions of FEM-2 cannot be said to lack functional importance, since fem-2 transgenes from the other species were unable to rescue the germ-line defect caused by a C. elegans fem-2 mutation. To test whether fem-2 functions as a sex-determining gene in the other Caenorhabditis species we used RNA-mediated interference (RNAi). fem-2 (RNAi) in C elegans and C. briggsae caused germ-line feminization, but had no noticeable effect in CB5161.

Here, we present a trans-species analysis of the cis-regulatory region of ceh-13, the worm ortholog of the Drosophila labial and the vertebrate Hox1 genes, and find that the molecular mechanisms that regulate its expression may be similar to what has been found in species that follow a regulative, non-cell-autonomous mode of development. We have identified two enhancer fragments that are involved in different aspects of the embryonic ceh-13 expression pattern. We show that important features of comma-stage expression depend on an autoregulatory input that requires ceh-13 and ceh-20 functions. Our data show that the molecular nature of Hox1 class gene autoregulation has been conserved between worms, flies, and vertebrates. The second regulatory sequence is sufficient to drive correct early embryonic expression of ceh-13. Interestingly, this enhancer fragment acts as a response element of the Wnt/WG signaling pathway in Drosophila')");

Cpl-1 gene (Ce-cpl-1:lacZ) is widely expressed in the intestine and hypodermal cells of transgenic worms, while the fusion protein (Ce-CPL-1::GFP) was expressed in the hypodermis, pharynx, and gonad. The CPL-1 native protein accumulates in early to late stage embryos and becomes highly concentrated in gut cells during late embryonic development. CPL-1 is also present near the periphery of the eggshell as well as in the cuticle of larval stages suggesting that it may function not only in embryogenesis but also in further development of the worm. Although the precise role of Ce-CPL-1 during embryogenesis is not yet clear it could be involved in the processing of nutrients responsible for synthesis and/or in the degradation of eggshell. Moreover, an increase in the cpl-1 mRNA is seen in the intermolt period approximately 4 h prior to each molt. During this process Ce-CPL-1 may act as a proteolytic enzyme in the processing/degradation of cuticular or other proteins.

In all organisms tested so far, only one transcript for the ICln protein could be identified. Here we show that two splice variants of the ICln ion channel can be found in Caenorhabditis elegans. Moreover,, we show that these two splice variants of the ICln channel protein, which we termed IClnN1 and IClnN2, can be functionally reconstituted and tested in an artificial lipid bilayer. In these experiments, the IClnN1-induced currents showed no voltage-dependent inactivation, whereas the IClnN2-induced currents fully inactivated at positive potentials. The molecular entity responsible for the voltage-dependent inactivation of IClnN2 is a cluster of positively charged amino acids encoded by exon 2a, which is absent in IClnN1. Our experiments suggest a mechanism of channel inactivation that is similar to the \"ball and chain\" model proposed for the Shaker potassium channel, i.e. a cluster of positively charged amino acids hinders ion permeation through the channel by a molecular and voltage-dependent interaction at the inner vestibulum of the pore. This hypothesis is supported by the finding that synthetic peptides with the same amino acid sequence as the positive cluster can transform the IClnN1-induced current to the current observed after reconstitution of IClnN2. Furthermore, we show that the nematode ICln gene is embedded in an operon harboring two additional genes, which we termed Nx and Ny. Co-reconstitution of Nx and IClnN2 and functional analysis of the related currents revealed a functional interaction between the two proteins, as evidenced by the fact that the IClnN2-induced current in the presence of Nx was no longer voltage-sensitive.

Here we present the characterization of a number of Tc3-like transposons in C. elegans, Caenorhabditis briggsae, and Drosophila melanogaster, which has revealed high levels of inter- and intra-specific diversity and further suggests a broad distribution of the Tc3-like transposons. These newly defined transposons and the previously described Tc3 and MsqTc3 form a highly divergent yet distinct clade in the Tc1 family. The above phylogenetic analysis of the Tc3-like transposons and their high levels of intra-specific diversity underscore interesting questions of their evolutionary dynamics in their respective hosts. The majority of the Tc3-like transposons contain two putative binding sites for their transposases. The first is near the terminus and the second is approximately 164-184 bp from the first site. Comparative analysis suggests that the second binding site may have been maintained for an important function in vivo. There is a large amount of variation in the length (27-566 bp) and structure of the terminal inverted repeats (TIRs) of Tc3-like transposons. Long (318-566 bp) TIRs that extend significantly beyond the second binding site are only found in the first described Tc3 and its close relatives, whose transposases form a recently derived clade among the Tc3-like transposons.

In this paper, we report that pop-1, the C elegans TCF/LEF-1 transcription factor, controls the first Z1/Z4 asymmetric division and hence controls proximal-distal axis formation. We have identified two pop-1(Sys) alleles (for symmetrical misters) that render the Z1/Z4 divisions symmetrical. The pop-1(q645) allele is fully penetrant for the Sys gonadogenesis defect in hermaphrodites, but affects male gonads weakly; pop-l(q645) alters a conserved amino acid in the beta-catenin binding domain. The pop-1(q624) allele is weakly penetrant for multiple defects and appears to be a partial loss-of-function mutation; pop-1(q624) alters a conserved amino acid in the HMG-box DNA binding domain. Zygotic pop-1(RNAi) confirms the role of pop-1 in Z1/Z4 asymmetry and reveals additional roles of pop-1, including one in leader cell migration. Two other Wnt pathway regulators, wrm-1 and lit-1, have the same effect as pop-1 on Z1/Z4 asymmetry. Therefore, wrm-1 and lit-1 are required for pop-1 function, rather than opposing it as observed in the early embryo. We conclude that POP-1 controls the Z1/Z4 asymmetric division and thereby establishes the proximaldistal axes of the gonad.

This is particularly important when searching a database of partial sequences, where short orthologous sequences from a non-conserved region will score much more poorly than non-orthologous (outgroup) sequences from a conserved region. Results: Such inferences are shown to be improved by conditioning the search results on the scores of an outgroup sequence. The log-odds score for each target sequence identified on the database has the log-odds score of the outgroup sequence subtracted from it. A test group of Caenorhabditis elegans kinase sequences and their identified C.elegans outgroups were searched against a test database of human Expressed Sequence Tag (EST) sequences, where the sets of true target sequences were known in advance. The outgroup conditioned method was shown to identify 58% more true positives ahead of the first false positive, compared to the straightforward search without an outgroup. A test dataset of 151 proteins drawn from the C.elegans genome, where the putative \'outgroup\' was assigned automatically, similarly found 50% more true positives using outgroup conditioning.

The results confirmed the hormone-like effect of humic substances. nine isolates significantly increased the numbers of offspring per worm, one isolate did not modulate the reproduction of C. elegans. This effect occurred with XAD isolates and with reverse osmosis isolates as well. Thus, this effect is an intrinsic feature of humic substances. This reproduction modulating potential of humic substances may be due to alkylaromatics that are major structural and photo stable structural components, rather than to sterols that are only minor structural components. This is a new view about the direct interactions of humic with aquatic organisms. The effects haven been mathematically modeled by a simple approach, considering a hormone-like effect (beta) and a non-hormone like effect, such as nutrient effect (alpha) on growth.

These proteins, MEC-4 and MEC-10, are required for touch sensation and can mutate to cause neuronal degeneration(2,3). Here we show that these mutant or \'d\' forms of MEC-4 and MEC-10 produce a constitutively active, amiloride-sensitive ionic current when co-expressed in Xenopus oocytes, but not on their own. MEC-2, a stomatin-related protein needed for touch sensitivity(4), increased the activity of mutant channels about 40-fold and allowed currents to be detected with wild-type MEC-4 and MEC-10. Whereas neither the central, stomatin-like domain of MEC-2 nor human stomatin retained the activity of full-length MEC-2, both produced amiloride-sensitive currents with MEC-4d. Our findings indicate that MEC-2 regulates MEC-4/MEC-10 ion channels and raise the possibility that similar ion channels may be formed by stomatin-like proteins and DEG/ENaC proteins that are co-expressed in both vertebrates and invertebrates(5-8).

Furthermore, SKR proteins exhibited diverse binding specificities for C. elegans F-box proteins. The tissue specificity of expression of the CUL1-interacting SKR proteins was also varied. Suppression of skr-1 or skr-2 genes by double-stranded RNA interference resulted in embryonic death, whereas that of skr-7, -8, -9, or -10 was associated with slow growth and morphological abnormalities. Conclusions: The multiple C. elegans SKR proteins exhibit marked differences in their association with Cullins and F-box proteins, in tissue specificity of expression, and in phenotypes associated with functional suppression by RNAi At least eight of the SKR proteins may, like F-box proteins, act as variable components of the SCF')");

Results: The 21 Skp1-related (skr) genes in C. elegans form one phylogenetic clade, suggesting that a single ancestral Skp1 gene underwent independent expansion in C. elegans. The cellular and developmental functions of the 21 C. elegans skr genes were probed by dsRNA-mediated gene inactivation (RNAi). The RNAi phenotypes of the skr genes fall into two classes. First, the highly similar skr-7, -8, -9, and -10 genes are required for posterior body morphogenesis, embryonic and larval development, and cell proliferation. Second, the related skr-1 and -2 genes are required for the restraint of cell proliferation, progression through the pachytene stage of meiosis, and the formation of bivalent chromosomes at diakinesis. CUL-1 was found to interact with SKR-1, -2, -3, -7, -8, and -10 in the yeast two-hybrid system. Interestingly, SKR-3 could interact with both CUL-1 and its close paralog CUL-6.

The tissue-specific distribution estimated by immunofluorescence staining and transgenic analysis of a gfp fusion gene (where GFP corresponds to green fluorescent protein) suggested that ABF-2 contributes to surface defence in the pharynx. abf-1 contains a single intron at a conserved position, suggesting that asabf and abf originated from a common ancestor. Both transcripts for abf-1 and abf-2 were detected as two distinct forms, i.e. spliced leader (SL)1-trans-spliced with a long 5\'-untranslated region (UTR) and SL-less with a short 5\'-UTR. A polycistronic precursor RNA encoding ABF-1 and ABF-2 was detected, suggesting that these genes form an operon. An \'opportunistic operon\' model for regulation of abf genes, including the generation of short SL-less transcripts, is proposed. In conclusion, C. elegans should have an immune defence system due to the antimicrobial peptides. C. elegans can be a novel model for innate immunity.

Recently, a study on long-lived clk-1 mutants of Caenorhabditis elegans demonstrated that biosynthesis of UQ is dramatically altered in mutant mitochondria. Demethoxy ubiquinone (DMQ), that accumulates in clk-4 mutants in place of UQ, may contribute to the extension of life span.

If double-strand breaks are prevented by spo-11 mutation, rad-51 RNAi does not affect chromosome appearance. This is consistent with a role for RAD-51 downstream of the initiation of recombination.
