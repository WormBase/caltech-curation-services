These results led to the proposal that a homolog recognition region (HRR), defined as the region containing those sequences enabling homologous chromosomes to pair and recombine, is localized near one end of each chromosome. Using translocations and duplications we have localized the chromosome I HRR to the right end. Whereas the other half of chromosome I did not confer any ability for homologs to pair and recombine, deficiencies in this region dominantly suppressed recombination to the middle of the chromosome. These deletions may have disrupted pairing mechanisms that are secondary to and require an HRR. Thus, the processes of pairing and recombination appear to utilize at least two chromosomal elements, the HRR and other pairing sites. For example, terminal sequences from other chromosomes increase the ability of free duplications to recombine with their normal homologs, suggesting that telomere-associated sequences, homologous or nonhomologous, play a role in facilitating meiotic exchange. Recombination can also initiate at internal sites separated from the HRR by chromosome rearrangement, such as deletions of the unc-54 region of chromosome I. When crossing over was suppressed in a region of chromosome I, compensatory increases were observed in other regions. Thus, the presence of the HRR enabled recombination to occur but did not determine the distribution of the crossover events.

To ascertain whether or not the low membrane potential was due to impalement damage, the same neurone was recorded from using two microelectrodes. The membrane potential following the first impalement by a 20 M-OMEGA 3 M KCl electrode was -38 mV and following the second impalement by a 80 M-OMEGA CBXF (for subsequent intracellular labelling) electrode was decreased to - 34 mV. Input resistance of these cells was estimated using both single and two electrode intracellular recording techniques and in both cases yielded a relatively high value for the size of cell (e.g. 25 M-OMEGA for a 100 mu-m cell). Neurones labelled by intracellular injection of the fluorescent market 5,6-carboxyfluorescein were morphologically simple and lacked extensive arborizations.

At 16 degrees C, however, the mutant lived considerably longer than the wild type, with mean life spans of approximately 28 and 21 days, respectively. This lengthened life span was due to slower development. It was also dependent upon oxygen concentration, because the mean life spans of rad-8 and wild type were experimentally identical when reared at 16 degrees C in the presence of 5% rather than atmospheric oxygen.

During the development of this animal, 131 of 1,090 ultimate somatic cells undergo programmed cell death.  Using mutagenesis techniques, several genes responsible for this death have been identified.  In this study, we have taken advantage of the ced-1 mutant in which dead cells accumulate, as they cannot be phagocytized and removed.    Although changes in `Ca2+‹i have been studied in relation to cell injury and cell death, observations have been essentially restricted to in vitro monolayer cultures because of the methodology involved. To study the relationship between changes in `Ca2+‹i and injury in vivo, we selected this animal model for further study and report here the morphological changes following the effects of ionomycin treatment in relation to increases of `Ca2+‹i and cell death as measured using the fluorescent probes Fluo-3/AM and propidium iodide, respectively.  The technique of confocal laser scanning microscopy is ideally adapted to such measurements in these living animals, and the results can be readily correlated with those made with Nomarski differential interference contrast microscopy as well as with transmission electron microscopy. The results support previous in vitro observations and show that early increases of `Ca2+‹i accompany early reactions to injury. Furthermore, the results also show that changes in this small invertebrate metazoan parallel those seen in mammalian systems, including human.

Transgenic analysis shows that expression of ubq-2 is regulated by an upstream promoter and a downstream element. The downstream element is required for ubq-2 promoter activity in embryos and in cells of the somatic gonad, including the distal tip cells, sheath cells, spermathecal cells, and cells of the uterus. The gonad-specific activity of the downstream regulator is transferable to a stress gene promoter such that heat-inducible expression of the transgene occurs in the somatic gonad. Stress-inducible beta-galactosidase expression in the gonad does not occur in all life stages, but is initiated late in the second or early in the third larval stage, when differentiation of gonadal tissues begins. Expression of a beta-galactosidase fusion protein from constructs containing the downstream ubq-2 regulator causes abnormalities of the gonad and embryonic lethality.

However, this machinery is activated by a distinct pathway, as loss of egl-1 function, which inhibits somatic cell death, does not affect germ cell apoptosis.

Here we show that the Caenorhabditis elegans gene, zk1248.3 (ehs-1), is the orthologue of Eps15 in nematodes, and that its product, EHS-1, localizes to synaptic-rich regions. ehs-l-impaired worms showed temperature-dependent depletion of synaptic vesicles and uncoordinated movement. These phenotypes could be correlated with a presynaptic defect in neurotransmission. Impairment of EHS-1 function in dyn-1(ky51) worms, which express a mutant form of dynamin and display a temperature-sensitive locomotion defects, resulted in a worsening of the dyn-1 phenotype and uncoordination at the permissive temperature. Thus, ehs-1 and dyn-1 interact genetically. Moreover, mammalian Eps15 and dynamin protein were shown to interact in vivo. Taken together, our results indicate that EHS-1 acts in synaptic vesicle recycling and that its function might be linked to that of dynamin.' WHERE joinkey = 'cgc4812';");

Mutagenic insertions constitute molecular tags that are used to rapidly clone the mutated gene. Such techniques would be especially advantageous in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, as the entire sequence of the genome has been determined. Several different types of endogenous transposons are present in C. elegans, and these can be mobilized in mutator strains (reviewed in ref. 1). Unfortunately, use of these native transposons for regulated transposition in C. elegans is limited. First, all strains contain multiple copies of these transposons and thus new insertions do not provide unique tags. Second, mutator strains tend to activate the transposition of several classes of transposons, so that the type of transposon associated with a particular mutation is not known. Here we demonstrate that the Drosophila mariner element Mos1 can be mobilized in C. elegans. First, efficient mobilization of Mos1 is possible in somatic cells. Second, heritable insertions of the transposon can be generated in the germ line. Third, genes that have been mutated by insertion can be rapidly identified using inverse polymerase chain reaction.

These domains may represent components of signals that target synaptogyrin for endocytosis from the plasma membrane and direct synaptogyrin to synaptic vesicles, respectively. In chimeric studies, these regions were sufficient to relocalize cellugyrin, a nonneuronal form of synaptogyrin, from nonsynaptic regions such as the sensory dendrites and the cell body to synaptic vesicles. Furthermore, GFP-tagged rat synaptogyrin is synaptically localized in neurons of C. elegans and in cultured hippocampal neurons.

On the basis of homeodomain similarity, the vertebrate Pitx genes appear to be orthologs of unc-30, a Caenorhabditis elegans gene necessary for differentiation of the GABAergic phenotype of type D neurons. One of the Pitx genes, Pitx2, is expressed in regions of GABAergic neurogenesis in the mammalian brain. These observations led us to test the functional conservation of the mouse Pitx2 and worm unc-30 genes using a rescue assay. Pitx2 rescues the GABAergic differentiation defect and partially rescues the axon guidance and behavioral phenotypes of unc-30 mutants, indicating a high degree of functional conservation between these evolutionarily related genes. Previous studies show that UNC-30 directly regulates the unc-25/glutamate decarboxylase gene that encodes the enzyme for GABA synthesis. We find that the promoter regions of the mouse and human genes coding for the 67 kDa glutamate decarboxylase (Gad1) also contain binding sites matching the UNC-30/Pitx2 consensus binding site sequence. We show that these sites specifically bind to Pitx2 protein in vitro and that in transfected neuroblastoma cells, the Pitx2 binding sites contribute to the basal activity of the Gad1 promoter. Furthermore, in cotransfection experiments, we find that Pitx2 strongly activates the Gad1 promoter. These results indicate that Pitx2 may regulate Gad1 expression in mammals, suggesting a new role for this key developmental transcription factor as a regulator of GABAergic differentiation during mammalian neural development.

Finally, we show that LAD-1 is phosphorylated in a fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) pathway-dependent manner on a tyrosine residue in the highly conserved ankyrin-binding motif, FIGQY, which was shown previously to abolish the L1 family of cell adhesion molecule (L1 CAM) binding to ankyrin in cultured cells. Immunofluorescence studies revealed that FIGQY-tyrosine-phosphorylated LAD-1 does not colocalize with nonphosphorylated LAD-1 or UNC-44 ankyrin but instead is localized to sites that undergo mechanical stress in polarized epithelia and axon-body wall muscle junctions. These findings suggest a novel ankyrin-independent role for LAD-1 related to FGFR signaling.

In cuticle, collagen and other proteins are cross-linked via di- and trityrosine linkages, and these linkages were absent in RNAi animals.

Recently, the Caenorhabditis elegans homolog of human JNK, jnk-1, and two MKK-7s, mek-1 and jkk-1, were cloned. Here we characterize jnk-1, which encodes two isoforms JNK-1 alpha and JNK-1 beta.

Similarly to jkk-1 mutants, elimination of GABAergic signals suppressed the jnk-1(gk7) locomotion defect. Like mek-1 nulls, jnk-1(gk7) showed copper and cadmium hypersensitivity. Conditional expression of JNK-1 isoforms rescued these defects, suggesting that they are not due to developmental errors. While jkk-1 or mek-1 inactivation mimicked jnk-1(gk7) locomotion and heavy metal stress defects, respectively, mkk-4 inactivation did not, but rather yielded defective egg laying.
