Approximately 65% of the total cAMP-dependent phosphotransferase activity is recovered in particulate fractions of homogenates prepared from asynchronous populations of C. elegans. The C subunit is expressed at a low level in cytosolic and particulate compartments during embryogenesis. As the nematodes progress from late embryonic stages to the newly hatched, first larval (L1) stage, C subunit content increases 15- fold. High levels of C subunits are observed in several subsequent larval and adult stages of development. Since the relative abundance of C subunit mRNA changes little with development, it appears that control of C expression is exerted the translational and/or post- translational levels. cDNAs for two types of C have been cloned and sequenced. The derived amino acid sequence of a major isoform (CeCAT alpha, 358 residues) is highly homologous (82% identical) with the murine C alpha subunit. A second, novel C subunit (CeCAT alpha\', 374 residues) has a unique 56-residue carboxyl-terminal region that is generated by the alternative splicing of the C pre-mRNA. The splicing process that yields CeCAT alpha\' is unusual because it converts the central portion of an apparent 1-kilobase (kb) intron to an exon. The alternative exon introduces the novel carboxyl terminus and a new translation stop signal, while simultaneously converting the coding sequence for 40 carboxyl-terminal residues in CeCAT alpha into 3\'- untranslated nucleotides. The 5\' end of the C. elegans C subunit mRNA is produced by the trans-splicing of the C gene transcript to a 22- base pair C. elegans leader sequence originally described by Krause, M., and Hirsh, D.

Genetic screens in Caenorhabditis elegans have identified numerous mutations that cause partial or complete loss of RNAi. In this work, we analyzed cleavage of injected dsRNA to produce the initial siRNA population in animals mutant for rde-1 and rde-4, two genes that are essential for RNAi but that are not required for organismal viability or fertility. Our results suggest distinct roles for RDE-1 and RDE-4 in the interference process. Although null mutants lacking rde-1 show no phenotypic response to dsRNA, the amount of siRNAs generated from an injected dsRNA trigger was comparable to that of wild-type. By contrast, mutations in rde-4 substantially reduced the population of siRNAs derived from an injected dsRNA trigger. Injection of chemically synthesized 24- or 25-nt siRNAs could circumvent RNAi resistance in rde-4 mutants, whereas no bypass was observed in rde-1 mutants.

Pmr1 co-localized with the Golgi-specific 58K protein and was targeted to a Ca2+ store that was less leaky for Ca2+ than the endoplasmic reticulum and whose inositol trisphosphate receptors were less sensitive to inositol trisphosphate and ATP than those in the endoplasmic reticulum. ATP-stimulated Pmr1-overexpressing cells responded after a latency to extracellular Ca2+ with a regenerative Ca2+ signal, which could be prevented by caffeine. They also produced very stable ilimaquinone-sensitive baseline Ca2+ spikes, even in the presence of thapsigargin. Such responses never occurred in non-transfected cells or in cells that overexpressed the type-1 sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+-)ATPase. Abortive Ca2+ spikes also occurred in histamine-stimulated untransfected HeLa cells pretreated with thapsigargin, and they too were inhibited by ilimaquinone.

In mammals, the plasma membrane AP-P can function as a kininase, but little is known about the physiological role of the cytosolic enzyme. The C. elegans genome contains a single gene encoding AP-P (W03G9.4), analysis of which predicts regions displaying high levels of amino-acid sequence homology between the predicted gene product and mammalian cytoplasmic AP-P, with the absolute conservation of key catalytic residues. The sequence of an EST (yk9lg4), comprising the open reading frame of W03G9.4, confirmed the predicted genomic structure of the gene and the prediction that W03G9.4 codes for a nonsecreted protein with a molecular mass of 68 kDa. Nematodes transformed with a promoter reporter construct, W03G9.4::GFP, showed high levels of fluorescence in the intestine of larvae and adult hermaphrodites, indicating that the intestine is a major site of W03G9.4 expression. yk9lg4 tagged with a hexahistidine and DLYDDDDK peptide epitope was expressed in Escherichia coli to yield, after affinity purification, a recombinant protein with a molecular mass of 71 kDa. The recombinant W03G9.4 removed the N-terminal amino acid from bradykinin (RPPGFSPFR), a Caenorhabditis elegans neuropeptide (KPSFVRFamide) and Lem Trp 1 (APSGFLGVRamide), but did not display activity towards angiotensin I (NRVYIHPFHL), des-Arg bradykinin and AF1 (KNEFIRFamide). The activity towards bradykinin was inhibited by EDTA and 1, 10 phenanthroline, as expected for a metalloenzyme, and also by apstatin (IC50, 1 muM), a selective inhibitor of mammalian AP-P. A K-m of 45 muM and an optimum pH of 7-8 was observed with bradykinin as the substrate. The activity of the nematode AP-P, like its mammalian counterparts, was strongly influenced by metal ions, with Co2+ Mn2+ and Zn2+ all inhibiting the hydrolysis of bradykinin. We conclude that W03G9.4 codes for a cytoplasmic AP-P with very similar enzymatic properties to those of mammalian AP-P, and we suggest that the enzyme has a physiological role in the intracellular hydrolysis of proline-containing peptides absorbed from the lumen of the intestine.')");

Only three of the neuropeptides had potent effects at low nanomolar concentrations, consistent with a physiological role in pharyngeal regulation. Therefore, we assessed whether these three peptides mediated their actions either directly on the pharynx or indirectly via the neural circuit controlling its activity by comparing actions between wild-type and mutants with deficits in synaptic signaling. Our data support the conclusion that AF1 and SAEPFGTMRFamide regulate the activity of the pharynx indirectly, whereas APEASPFIRFamide exerts its action directly. These results are in agreement with the expression pattern for the genes encoding the neuropeptides (Mm and Li, 1999) as both flp-8 and flp-3 are expressed in extrapharyngeal neurons, whereas flp-13 is expressed in 15, a neuron with synaptic output to the pharyngeal muscle.

We show that one of the five isoforms of C. elegans eIF4E, IFE-1, is enriched in the germline and is a component of germ granules (P granules). The association of IFE-1 with P granules requires the P-granule protein PGL-1. In vitro PGL-1 interacts directly with IFE-1, but not with the other four isoforms of eIF4E. Analysis of animals depleted of IFE-1 by RNAi shows that IFE-1 is required for spermatogenesis, specifically for efficient progression through the meiotic divisions and for the production of functional sperm, in both hermaphrodites and males. The requirement for IFE-1 is highly sensitive to temperature. IFE-1 is not required for oogenesis, as ife-1(RNAi) hermaphrodites produce viable progeny when normal sperm are supplied. Consistent with a primary role in spermatogenesis, ife-1 m-RNA levels are highest in regions of the gonad undergoing spermatogenesis.

We show within the upstream region, the presence of B and C subelement-like sequences of myo-2, which may be used to stimulate pharyngeal expression. Despite the presence of a ges-1 like sequence, we were unable to locate the two GATA sites required for intestinal expression.

A truncated version of the cAGT-2 protein was expressed in E. coli. This purified recombinant protein was able to repair O-6-methyl-guanine and O-4-methylthymine adducts in DNA in vitro and also reacted with the bulky benzyl adduct in O-6-benzylguanine. This fragment of cAGT-2 (104 amino acids) is the smallest protein possessing AGT activity yet described. The full-length cAGT-2 protein (274 amino acids) totally lacks the N-terminal domain present in all other known AGTs but has a long C-terminal extension that has significant homology to histone 1C. Expression of cAGT-2 in an E. coli strain lacking endogenous AGT activity provided modest but statistically significant resistance to the toxicity of N-methyl-N\'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine, confirming that cAGT-2 is an alkyltransferase.')");

Mutant analyses in mice and Drosophila have implicated these genes in outgrowth of structures, cell adhesion, cell migration, and cell fate decisions. We have investigated the expression and function of ceh-43, the Dll ortholog from the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, by using gfp reporter constructs and double-stranded RNA-mediated interference (RNAi). Our results show that, as in the fly, the C. elegans Dll ortholog seems to play a role in cell adhesion. An antibody against the butterfly Distal-less homeodomain stains the nervous system of C. elegans embryos (Panganiban et al. [1997] Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 94:5162-5166). GFP expression under the control of the ceh-43 promoter looks similar, although strong expression is primarily confined to the head hypodermis and to neuronal support cells. ceh43(RNAi) results in 100% lethality at embryonic or early larval stages. At the beginning of morphogenesis, ceh-43(RNAi) embryos start to lose cells through a hole in the head hypodermis. They either rupture interiorly as elongation proceeds, or they elongate normally to threefold egg length with the pharynx not connected to the mouth. Elongated ceh-43(RNAi) animals die before or soon after hatching with a fluid-filled pseudocoel and large vacuoles. These phenotypes suggest a role for ceh-43 in development of adhesive properties in the head hypodermis that connects the epithelia of the skin and the digestive tract. Furthermore, possible defects in the excretory system may result at least in part from a requirement for ceh-43 in the CAN neurons where ceh-43::gfp is also expressed.')");

The DNA binding domain of CEP-1 is related to vertebrate p53 members and possesses the conserved residues most frequently mutated in human tumors. Consistent with this, CEP-1 acts as a transcription factor and is able to activate a transcriptional reporter containing consensus human p53 binding sites.

Pax-5 recruits Ets-1 to bind the promoter, but not the closely related Ets protein SAP1a. Here we show that, while several different mutations increase binding of SAP1a to an optimized Ets binding site, only conversion of Val68 to an acidic amino acid facilitates ternary complex assembly with Pax-5 on the mb-1 promoter. This suggests that enhanced DNA binding by SAP1 a is not sufficient for recruitment by Pax-5, but instead involves protein-protein interactions mediated by the acidic side chain. Recruitment of Ets proteins by Pax-5 requires GIn22 within the N-terminal beta -hairpin motif of its paired domain. The beta -hairpin also participates in recognition of a subset of Pax-5-binding sites. Thus, Pax-5 incorporates protein-protein interaction and DNA recognition functions in a single motif. The Caenorhabditis elegans Pax protein EGL-38 also binds specifically to the mb-1 promoter and recruits murine Ets-1 or the C.elegans Ets protein T08H4.3, but not the related LIN-1 protein. Together, our results define specific amino acid requirements for Pax-Ets ternary complex assembly and show that the mechanism is conserved between evolutionarily related proteins of diverse animal species.

Before cell death, neuronal dysfunction may be an important step of HD pathogenesis. To explore polyQ-mediated neuronal toxicity, we expressed the first 57 amino acids of human htt containing normal [19 Gin residues (Gins)] and expanded (88 or 128 Gins) polyQ fused to fluorescent marker proteins in the six touch receptor neurons of Caenorhabditis elegans. Expanded polyQ produced touch insensitivity in young adults. Noticeably, only 28 +/- 6% of animals with 128 Gins were touch sensitive in the tail, as mediated by the PLM neurons. Similar perinuclear deposits and faint nuclear accumulation of fusion proteins with 19, 88, and 128 Gins were observed. In contrast, significant deposits and morphological abnormalities in PLM cell axons were observed with expanded polyQ (128 Gins) and partially correlated with touch insensitivity. PLM cell death was not detected in young or old adults. These animals indicate that significant neuronal dysfunction without cell death may be induced by expanded polyQ and may correlate with axonal insults, and not cell body aggregates. These animals also provide a suitable model to perform in vivo suppression of polyQ-mediated neuronal dysfunction.')");

Proper AJM-1 localization requires LET-413 and DLG-1, homologues of the Drosophila tumour suppressors Scribble and Discs large, respectively. DLG-1 physically interacts with AJM-1 and is required for its normal apical distribution, and LET-413 mediates the rapid accumulation of both DLG-1 and AJM-1 in the apical domain. In the absence of both dlg-1 and let-413 function AJM-1 is almost completely lost from apical junctions in embryos, whereas HMP-1 (alpha -catenin) localization is only mildly affected.

To analyse whether transgenic C. elegans are able to carry out processing and post-transcriptional modifications of the Ov-GST1a correctly. the protein was ectopically overexpressed in C. elegans.

In this way it was possible to systematically check the influence of different inducers on CYP expression at the same time.
