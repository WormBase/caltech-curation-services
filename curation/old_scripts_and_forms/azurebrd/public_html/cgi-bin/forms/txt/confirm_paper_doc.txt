Your WBPerson number and Standard name are displayed.  This will be used to 
track down who validated these connections between you and your papers. 
Please don't use this form for someone else's data.  If you would like
to do so, please contact cecilia@minerva.caltech.edu

Your papers will be in batches of up to 10 papers (so as not to take too
long to load all papers if you have a large amount of papers), please select
a batch and click ``Select !''

After clicking ``Select !'', your WBPerson entry will be displayed.  If 
some of it is not up-to-date, please email cecilia@minerva.caltech.edu
to update your entry.  This should be the same data displayed in WormBase.

Each paper entry has its own table with its reference information.
Under author a first pass curator has marked the entries that may be yours.
These have a radio button, for you to mark each paper as Yours or Not Yours.
After making selections for all papers click the ``Edit !'' button, then 
go back and select another batch of papers if there are others left
unselected.

If you have published any C. elegans papers that are not on the list, 
please leave a Comment using the Comment box and clicking the ``Comment !''
button.  (This will also email cecilia@minerva.caltech.edu your data)
