# What's here

File structure on tazendra was in 
- /home/acedb/ for curators 
- /home/azurebrd/ for quick work and parsings by Juancarlos, as well as publicly accessible forms 
- /home/postgres/ for postgres dumpers, processing, and loading, and IP-restricted curation forms

This folder is for backing up scripts and forms that were in those directories, without porting them over to work in the dockerized system (different way to call perl, needing dotenv for parameters, etc.)
