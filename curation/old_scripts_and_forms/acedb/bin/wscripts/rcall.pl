# There's a program called expect that you can use to wrap telnet into a
# script.  It's part of the TCL distribution.  However, I'd do the whole
# thing in perl.
# 
# Here's a small perl client that you can use to communicate with a
# server on a port somewhere.  You could open a pipe to it to handle
# all the socket communications, and capture its output to a file.
# 
# If you try the script and it complains that it can't find
# sys/socket.ph, you need to run the perl h2ph program to perl-ize the
# system's /include/sys/socket.h file and install the .ph file in
# /usr/local/lib/perl5/sys/.
# 
# Good luck,
