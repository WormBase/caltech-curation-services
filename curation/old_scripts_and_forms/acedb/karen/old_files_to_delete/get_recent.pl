interval stuff : 
SELECT * FROM afp_passwd WHERE joinkey NOT IN (SELECT joinkey FROM afp_lasttouched) AND joinkey NOT IN (SELECT joinkey FROM cfp_curator) AND afp_timestamp < CURRENT_TIMESTAMP - interval '21 days' AND afp_timestamp > CURRENT_TIMESTAMP - interval '28 days';

casting stuff to substring on other types :
SELECT * FROM afp_passwd WHERE CAST (afp_timestamp AS TEXT) ~ '2009-05-14';
