# check how many author <-> paper connections there, how many have been assigned
# to possible persons, and how many have been verified  2007 02 27
#
# figure out how many people are not verifying their data.  2007 03 01
#
# Edited to get a list of PIs and their lineage associations.
# Look at each author->person that has not verified.  Find the Paper,
# find any PI that _has_ verified, and if the possible person is in the
# PI's lineage, print it out.  Sort by two# needing verification.
# 2007 03 08

# try to match by Lab and Oldlab instead of PI.  2007 03 08
#
# This program is a lot faster than the lineage program.  2007 03 16
#
# Converted from Pg.pm to DBI.pm  2009 04 17
#
# Converted for pap_ tables from wpa_
# Now does lineage and labs at the same time
# Also works recursively while there's data to connect.  2010 06 21
